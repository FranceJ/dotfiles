This colour scheme is intended to be pleasant for the eyes when working in low-light conditions. The low contrast will reduce eyestrain.

If you like to work in a darkened room with a fullscreen Vim, this is for you! Even if you don't, try this one out :-)

There is now a higher-contrast mode (with darker background) which is enabled via ":let g:zenburn_high_Contrast=1" then ":colors zenburn". See the syntax file itself for further options.

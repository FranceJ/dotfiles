[m[1mDESCRIPTION[m
    The [1mgcloud[m CLI manages authentication, local configuration, developer
    workflow, and interactions with the Google Cloud APIs.

    For a quick introduction to the gcloud command-line tool, a list of
    commonly used commands, and a look at how these commands are structured,
    run [1mgcloud cheat-sheet[m or refer to the gcloud command-line tool cheat
    sheet: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/cheatsheet

[m[1mGLOBAL FLAGS[m
     [1m--account[m=[4mACCOUNT[m
        Google Cloud user account to use for invocation. Overrides the default
        [1mcore/account[m property value for this command invocation.

     [1m--billing-project[m=[4mBILLING_PROJECT[m
        The Google Cloud project that will be charged quota for operations
        performed in gcloud. If you need to operate on one project, but need
        quota against a different project, you can use this flag to specify the
        billing project. If both [1mbilling/quota_project[m and [1m--billing-project[m
        are specified, [1m--billing-project[m takes precedence. Run [1m$ gcloud config
        set --help[m to see more information about [1mbilling/quota_project[m.

     [1m--configuration[m=[4mCONFIGURATION[m
        The configuration to use for this command invocation. For more
        information on how to use configurations, run: [1mgcloud topic
        configurations[m. You can also use the CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME
        environment variable to set the equivalent of this flag for a terminal
        session.

     [1m--flags-file[m=[4mYAML_FILE[m
        A YAML or JSON file that specifies a [1m--flag[m:[1mvalue[m dictionary. Useful
        for specifying complex flag values with special characters that work
        with any command interpreter. Additionally, each [1m--flags-file[m arg is
        replaced by its constituent flags. See $ gcloud topic flags-file for
        more information.

     [1m--flatten[m=[[4mKEY[m,...]
        Flatten [4mname[m[] output resource slices in [4mKEY[m into separate records for
        each item in each slice. Multiple keys and slices may be specified.
        This also flattens keys for [1m--format[m and [1m--filter[m. For example,
        [1m--flatten=abc.def[m flattens [1mabc.def[].ghi[m references to [1mabc.def.ghi[m. A
        resource record containing [1mabc.def[][m with N elements will expand to N
        records in the flattened output. This allows us to specify what
        [1mresource-key[m the [1mfilter[m will operate on. This flag interacts with other
        flags that are applied in this order: [1m--flatten[m, [1m--sort-by[m, [1m--filter[m,
        [1m--limit[m.

     [1m--format[m=[4mFORMAT[m
        Set the format for printing command output resources. The default is a
        command-specific human-friendly output format. The supported formats
        are: [1mconfig[m, [1mcsv[m, [1mdefault[m, [1mdiff[m, [1mdisable[m, [1mflattened[m, [1mget[m, [1mjson[m, [1mlist[m,
        [1mmulti[m, [1mnone[m, [1mobject[m, [1mtable[m, [1mtext[m, [1mvalue[m, [1myaml[m. For more details run $
        gcloud topic formats.

     [1m--help[m
        Display detailed help.

     [1m--project[m=[4mPROJECT_ID[m
        The Google Cloud project ID to use for this invocation. If omitted,
        then the current project is assumed; the current project can be listed
        using [1mgcloud config list --format='text(core.project)'[m and can be set
        using [1mgcloud config set project PROJECTID[m.

        [1m--project[m and its fallback [1mcore/project[m property play two roles in the
        invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate on. It
        also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota, and
        billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing, use
        [1m--billing-project[m or [1mbilling/quota_project[m property.

     [1m--quiet[m, [1m-q[m
        Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
        is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.
        Overrides the default core/disable_prompts property value for this
        command invocation. This is equivalent to setting the environment
        variable [1mCLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS[m to 1.

     [1m--verbosity[m=[4mVERBOSITY[m; default="warning"
        Override the default verbosity for this command. Overrides the default
        [1mcore/verbosity[m property value for this command invocation. [4mVERBOSITY[m
        must be one of: [1mdebug[m, [1minfo[m, [1mwarning[m, [1merror[m, [1mcritical[m, [1mnone[m.

     [1m--version[m, [1m-v[m
        Print version information and exit. This flag is only available at the
        global level.

     [1m-h[m
        Print a summary help and exit.

[m[1mOTHER FLAGS[m
     [1m--access-token-file[m=[4mACCESS_TOKEN_FILE[m
        A file path to read the access token. Use this flag to authenticate
        gcloud with an access token. The credentials of the active account (if
        exists) will be ignored. The file should only contain an access token
        with no other information. Overrides the default [1mauth/access_token_file[m
        property value for this command invocation.

     [1m--impersonate-service-account[m=[4mSERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAILS[m
        For this gcloud invocation, all API requests will be made as the given
        service account instead of the currently selected account. This is done
        without needing to create, download, and activate a key for the
        account. In order to perform operations as the service account, your
        currently selected account must have an IAM role that includes the
        iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission for the service account.
        The roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role has this permission or
        you may create a custom role. A list of service accounts, separated
        with comma, can be specified. In such cases, it creates an
        impersonation delegation chain. Any given service account in the list
        must have the roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on its
        subsequent service account. For example, when
        --impersonate-service-account=sv1@developer.gserviceaccount.com,sv2@developer.gserviceaccount.com,
        the active account must have the roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator
        role on sv1@developer.gserviceaccount.com which must has the
        roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role on
        sv2@developer.gserviceaccount.com. sv2@developer.gserviceaccount.com is
        target impersonated service account and
        sv1@developer.gserviceaccount.com is the delegate. Overrides the
        default [1mauth/impersonate_service_account[m property value for this
        command invocation.

     [1m--log-http[m
        Log all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr. Overrides the
        default [1mcore/log_http[m property value for this command invocation.

     [1m--trace-token[m=[4mTRACE_TOKEN[m
        Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
        issues. Overrides the default [1mcore/trace_token[m property value for this
        command invocation.

     [1m--user-output-enabled[m
        Print user intended output to the console. Overrides the default
        [1mcore/user_output_enabled[m property value for this command invocation.
        Use [1m--no-user-output-enabled[m to disable.
